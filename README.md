# Files and Resouces for "Hunt and Trap Squirrels with an AI Powered Raspberry Pi" webinar

How cool would it be to make your Raspberry Pi powered project see and understand it’s environment, and even take actions?

In this webinar you’ll learn how PubNub brings the communication layer and how AIception brings the artificial brain layer, through understanding different domains, like object detection, face recognition, and much more.

We’ll put everything together using the PubNub AIception BLOCK to make a simple and fun, yet powerful, blueprint for your future projects.

Presented by:
Razvan Pistolea, CTO, AIception
